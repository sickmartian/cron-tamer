# Library usage

- We are using React with Vite (5.1.6), writting TypeScript, with Tailwind (3.4.1) and PostCSS (8.4.35) for styling
- Additionally we are using Jest (29.7.0) for tests and Luxon (3.5.0) for sane date parsing and timezone translation
- Respect the versions of those librearies when looking at documentation and applying code

# When building new features

– Prefer simpler solutions
– Check for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality when implementing something, and refactor
– Write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, and prod
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes, suggest these
- If you add new patterns or technologies, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we don’t have duplicate logic

# Cron Tamer

A tool to visualize and compare cron schedules across different timezones.

## Motivation and support

This app was to scratch an itch, I have multiple cron jobs competing for the same resource, I needed an easy way to find which ones were colliding and overwhelming this resource and a way to easily find good slots for them.

I'm not a very FE person, this was started by vibe coding using Cursor and I had to get involved to solve timezone bugs and make it perform decently. It's currently good enough for me, so I wouldn't expect much movement on this repo.
